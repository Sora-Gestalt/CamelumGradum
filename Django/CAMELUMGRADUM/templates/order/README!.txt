-------------------------------|  Important Document! |-------------------------------

        The {Orders.py} file in [order] DIR is an example for the Class |Coffee Bags|
        Once the Real file is made on the [Django main project file] this file should
        Be deleted and thats include this {README!.txt} text file.
                                            

                                        Thank You! (:
